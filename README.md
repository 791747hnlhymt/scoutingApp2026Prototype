# 🤖 FRC Scouting App (Web Prototype)

This is a **web-based scouting app prototype** built to help FRC teams collect, track, and analyze data from robotics matches. The app allows you to input team performance data (both subjective and objective), and after logging all the robot actions, it will calculate and display **averages** to help with alliance selection and match strategy.
