Hello, and welcome to the Scouting App 2026 prototype!

We created this website to support newer FRC teams in Indiana. Being a new FRC team can be challenging due to limited materials and time. We wanted to help by developing a web-based scouting app that teams can quickly start using and easily modify to fit their needs.

This is a PWA, which stands for Progressive Web Application.
How a PWA works is that when you first enter the website it will catche all the nessicary files into your storage and that the website will act like an application.



Tech stack: Html , CSS , js 
basic website requirements 


The reason why we chose to make an website and not an app is beacuase websites are easier to learn and faster to code.
